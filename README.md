# 🧠 Coppelia: The Cognitive Forge

Coppelia is a **modular autonomous system** designed to recursively **generate**, **evaluate**, and **evolve** LangChain-compatible tools through structured, agent-driven reasoning. It embodies a self-refining cognitive engine capable of identifying capability gaps, building tools to fill them, and iteratively improving their effectiveness with minimal human intervention.

## 🚀 System Overview

### Architecture Phases:

1. **Project Foundation & Architecture**  
   Tool structure, registry, evaluator, orchestrator.

2. **Agentic Tool-Building Pipeline**  
   Builder → Tester → Fixer → Evaluator loop with prompt templating.

3. **Tool Evolution & Multiplicity**  
   Mutation tracking, versioning, and ensemble-based selection.

4. **Finalization Sweep**  
   Codebase review, documentation integrity, and quality enforcement.

## 🧩 Core Components

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Tool`           | Encapsulates functional code, metadata, and test cases. |
| `ToolRegistry`   | Handles persistent storage and retrieval of tools. |
| `evaluate_tool()`| Runs simulated evaluations on tools with test case logs. |
| `runner.py`      | Coordinates full pipeline execution autonomously. |
| `*_agent.py`     | Specialized LLM agents (Builder, Tester, Fixer, Ensemble). |

---

## 🧪 Test Protocol

All testing logs and results are stored in:  
📄 `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`

| Metric          | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Pass %          | Proportion of test cases passed           |
| Coverage %      | Proportion of features evaluated          |
| Issues Detected | Bug reports, failures, or misalignments   |
| Fixes Applied   | Notes on resolutions applied              |

## 💼 Usage

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Initialize Project Structure**

   ```bash
   python scaffold_coppelia.py
   ```

3. **Run Coppelia**

   ```bash
   python core/runner.py
   ```

> ⚠️ All execution flows follow a strict Phase → Task → Step hierarchy with embedded internal verifications.
